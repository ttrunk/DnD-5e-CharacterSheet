# DnD-5e-CharacterSheet
D&amp;D 5e electronic character sheet

beginner programmer, wanted a fun project to learn so I made this electronic character sheet for 5th edition dungeons
and dragons. It is functional but it is still a work in progress!

To run the program launch form.py

TIPS:
Don't use the '|' character. At all. This character is used as the csv file delimeter.
Use of this character within the sheet will have negative affects on the placement of your data when you load.

You can change the color of the program background. Just enter a valid HEX color value into the appropriate field
and save. Then Restart the program.

You can control the image displayed within the program. Just enter a valid image file path into the appropriate field
and save. Then Restart the program. The image should be Max Height = 160 Max Width = 135 or it could have negative
visual affects.

Dice Roller included.
